###Project
Assignment 2016: Measuring Stability Using the Reflection API File

###Overview
Project's main focus was the usage of Reflection. The ability to dynamically inspect types at run-time.</br>
Java App creates an object graph through inheritence + composition.</br>
Dynamic inspection of object grap can be done through the usage of *Java Reflection API*. **(java.util.reflect)**</br>
It allows the class to be inspected about structure (constructors, methods, returns etc...) of the said class.</br>

That said, this project also gave me a decent try at the *Java Swing* GUI widget toolkit and *Java Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT)*.</br>

####Project Information
**JAR FIle***(Java ARchive)*: User will select JAR file through file explorer which then will be inspected/analysed for all its classes.</br>
The data is obtained and In-Degree *(Affarent Coupling)* and Out-Degree*(Efferent Coupling)* is being calculated of the classes inspected.<br>

*Coupling* | *Description*
---------|----------
**Afferent Couplings (Ca):**| The number of classes in other packages that depend upon classes within the package is an indicator of the package's responsibility. *Afferent = incoming.*
**Efferent Couplings (Ce):**| The number of classes in other packages that the classes in the package depend upon is an indicator of the package's dependence on externalities. *Efferent = outgoing.*
